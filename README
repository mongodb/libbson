# libbson

libbson is a library providing useful routines related to building, parsing,
and iterating BSON documents.  It is a useful base for those wanting to write
high-performance C extensions to higher level languages such as python, ruby,
or perl.


# Building

## From Git

```sh
$ ./autogen.sh --enable-silent-rules
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

You can run the unit tests with

```sh
$ make test
```

## From Tarball

```sh
$ ./configure --enable-silent-rules
$ make
$ sudo make install
```


# Overview


## Types

The following list details the various types in libbson and their use.  See
their individual headers for documentation on the available functions and
macros.


### bson\_t

The bson\_t structure is encapsulates a BSON document buffer. It manages
growing the buffer using power of 2 allocations as new fields are appended to
the BSON document.

Functions working upon a bson\_t that do not mutate state are marked as
"const bson\_t \*". These functions are safe to use with an inline sequence of
BSON documents as such might be found in a MongoDB wire-protocol packet.


### bson\_iter\_t

Iterating upon a bson\_t is performed using a stack allocated bson\_iter\_t.
These structures do not need to be cleaned up after and therefore can be
discarded at any time (meaning there is no bson\_iter\_destroy() function).

Various functions are provided to access fields of different types. You can get
the field name with bson\_iter\_key() and the field type with
bson\_iter\_type(). Additionally, the BSON\_ITER\_HOLDS\_\*() macros are a
convenient way to check a fields type.


### bson\_visitor\_t

If you would like to iterate upon all of the fields of a BSON you may be
interested in bson\_visitor\_t. It provides a callback style visitor that will
call a function for each field found. This is typically useful when building a
document in a higher level language binding such as Python, Ruby, or Perl.


### bson\_context\_t

To aid in performance critical functions, a bson\_context\_t may be required.
Think of this structure as a "library" handle. It allows fine tuning of
configuration so that various optimizations may occur. This is particularly
useful with OID generation so that shared state may be avoided. Optimizations
that avoid mutexes or atomic increments can be performed here.

Some systems may not know when fork() has been called underneath them as well
as hostname changes. Checking for these often has serious performance
implications and therefore are opt-in. See bson\_context\_flags\_t for more
information.


### bson\_oid\_t

This structure contains a 12-byte BSON ObjectId. Various routines are provided
to manipulate the ObjectId's as well as convert to and from strings.


### bson\_reader\_t

In various drivers you may need to parse a sequential stream of BSON documents.
Reducing the number of allocations in this process has positive implications
for speed of parsing. bson\_reader\_t helps abstract the parsing of a
sequential list of BSON documents.

Additionally, you can parse a stream of BSON documents from a file using
bson\_reader\_init\_from\_fd(). This is handy if you are processing backups
from the mongodump command.


### bson\_writer\_t

It would be useful to be able to create wire-protocol packets while serializing
directly to the same buffer. bson\_writer\_t achieves this by allowing the
caller to provide a malloc()d buffer and a realloc() function to resize the
buffer. Additionally, you may set an offset in the buffer to start from. This
is useful since you can start encoding to the buffer directly after the message
header structure. Buffers are grown in powers of two.


## Performance Tricks


### Serialize Documents into Output Buffer

You can use bson\_writer\_t to serialize your dictionary/hash types to the
target packet buffer.  It supports providing a realloc function to resize the
packet buffer as you go.  This saves you many small allocations and instead has
one large growing allocation.  This should help with memory fragmentation
greatly.


### Build sub-documents with bson\_append\_document\_begin()

When building a sub-document, you have two options. You can build the bson\_t
structure on its own, using its own allocations. Or, you can use
bson\_append\_document\_begin() and bson\_append\_document\_end() to build the
document inside of the parent document. This allows you to use one allocation
for both rather than multiple.


### Keep small documents on the stack

bson\_t will use an inline buffer for small documents. Any document under 56
bytes can be built inline on the stack. bson\_t will automatically switch to a
malloc()d buffer when overflowing that internal buffer.

Remember that even if you are building a bson\_t on the stack, you are required
to call bson\_destroy().
